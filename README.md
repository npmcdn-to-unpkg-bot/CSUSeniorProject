#### Running
First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once that is installed run:

```
git clone https://github.com/nvladimiroff/CSUSeniorProject.git
cd CSUSeniorProject
npm install
```

npm will download and install all the dependancies, and once its finished, you can run ```npm start``` to start the server. Then all you need to do is open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
